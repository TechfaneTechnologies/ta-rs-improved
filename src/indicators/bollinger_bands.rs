/// A Bollinger Bands (BB).
/// (BB).
/// It is a type of infinite impulse response filter that calculates Bollinger Bands using Exponential Moving Average.
/// The Bollinger Badns are represented by Average EMA and standard deviaton that is moved 'k' times away in both directions of calculated average value.
/// 
/// # Formula
///
/// Bollinger Bands are calculated based on EMA combined with Standard Deviaiation(SD).
///
/// See EMA doumentation.
///
/// ![SD formula](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8715d659116bec91d48762b9e1f3d9aed36fc028)
///
/// Where:
///
/// * _SD<sub>s</sub>_ - is value of standard deviation for N given probes.
/// * _SD<sub>Ÿç-</sub>_  - is the mean value of observation.
/// * _SD<sub>N</sub>_ - is number of probes in observation.
/// * _SD<sud>xi</sub>_ - is i-th observed value from N elements observation.
///
/// and then BB is composed as:
///
///    Middle Band = Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
///    Upper Band = N * (EMA + SD of observation * multipler (usually 2.0))
///    Lower Band = N * (EMA - SD of observation * multipler (usually 2.0))
